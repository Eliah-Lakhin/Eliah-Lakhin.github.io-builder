In this post I would like to explain why having incremental compiler is
important for browser based IDEs and text editors.

To understand what incremental compiler is, please take a look at the
[Demo web application](/projects/papa-carlo/demo/) I have published a few days
ago.

### Web IDE

These days popularity of the text editors made completely on top of web
technologies is growing fast. Probably, you have heared about such products as
Cloud9, Koding or even Atom.io from GitHub released recently. Tens if not
hundreds of new instances entering the stage.

These solutions are especially useful, because they provide user with a ready to
use remote development environment, and there are no special steps in
deployment. User just opening web-browser and voila, he/she has a ready to use
workstation. At first glance, it seems like a good solution for web developers
who are working with dynamic typing languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, PHP,
Python, etc.

However, we must admit they don't shine so much when we are talking about
static typing languages like Java, C# or Objective-C. Especially, when we are
comparing web editors with the major well known solutions for desktops such as
Visual Studio, IntelliJ Idea or Eclipse. The key difference of the desktop based 
"old-school" editors is the ability of deep syntax and semantic understanding of
the programming languages. Finally, they provide end users with a number of
handy and smart code manipulation instruments, including Code Completion,
Jump To Definition, Refactoring/Renaming. Having these features is very
important when we are working with the large codebase.

Internally, these editors accomplish their abilities by continuous indexing
source codes of the entire project files. They perform indexing using so called
["incremental parsers/compilers"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_compiler#Definition).
Incremental parsers are responsible for continuous scanning the code for method,
functions and variable definitions, and their application sites in the project
file's.

An incremental parsers is differ from the ordinary parser by a number of
properties:

1. **Continuous indexing the code in real time**. Ordinary compiler scans entire
source code once, and then it stops. If the end user changes something in
the code, the compiler should be run over and over. This approach is
inappropriate for IDEs, since complete compilation of the project may take
seconds if not minutes.

2. **Syntax error tolerance**. When the developer writing a code, the program is
frequently stands in the syntactic incorrect states. However, IDE must be able
to recognize the rest of the code. For example, to be able to provide the user
with the code completion feature in any place of the code.

3. **Mapping between the structure of the Parse Tree and the code**. All of the
nodes of the Parse Tree should keep track of the code segments they were
produced of. This property provides the Jump-To-Definition feature.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of development tools for incremental compilers
nowadays. Ordinary tools such as parser generators don't fit well. So,
developers usually have to implement these core parsers for the IDEs more or
less manually.

That's why I have developed my own parsing library -
[Papa Carlo](/projects/papa-carlo/) - designed especially for development of the
incremental compilers. API of the library should be familiar for the developers
who have worked with ordinary parser combinators and generators. But the
resulting parser has all of the features mentioned above out of the box.

The Demo example I referred in the beginning of the post is written on top of
the Papa Carlo library. It doesn't use server-side to process computations,
the parser works completely in the web browser. I believe this approach may
be scaled up to develop language support plugins for the modern Web Editors to
turn them to the full-featured IDEs comparable to the class of the desktop based
IDEs.

### A few words about the Demo

The library Papa Carlo is written in Scala and compiled to JavaScript using
ScalaJS compiler. So all of the computations performing completely on the
client-side. The server hosted only the static content: JS and HTML sources.

The parser is running in the WebWorker (if possible). Since that, application
loading is distributed between two threads: one of them is responsible for UI
management, and another one performce compilation.

All of the visual features are done with SVG using d3.js library. Code editor
on the left side of the screen is Code Mirror widget.
